# Historical-Pop-Demand
Combines both HPM (version 0.4.6.3) with PDM (latest version PDM_new_patch) in a single mod, without the economy changes from PDM. Currently in alpha, so bugs will happen! (old PDM bugs and new HPM mods). It still need a little cleaning here and there, but it's mostly functional. 
Please report any bugs you may find while playing!
